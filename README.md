# pokeSlow
pokeSlow now allows a user to select a PHBankGB Box 1 Pokemon and edit its pecies.

This was a fun little project I decided doing as a way to take a break from life for a bit.  It is used in conjunction with the Pokemon Homebrew Bank for the First Generation Virtual Console Games on the 3DS (also known as PHBankGB).  pokeSlow also has an option to convert all pokemon you have saved in the first box of the bank into Slowpokes for no reason besides pure amusement.

I'm thinking about adding an attack editor.

This app doesn't have any images besides the icon, but instead uses text menus to allow editing.

## Installation

Place the pokeSlow.3dsx and pokeSlow.smdh in the "3ds" directory of your SD Card, open up your favorite homebrew loader, and run the program.

Thanks to gocario for PHBankGB, xem for the fun 3DS Homebrew Tutorial, and the Citra development team for their emulator, Citra.
