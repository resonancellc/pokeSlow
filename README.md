# pokeSlow

This was a fun little project I decided doing as a way to take a break from life for a bit.  It is used in conjunction with the Pokemon Homebrew Bank for the First Generation Virtual Console Games on the 3DS (also known as PHBankGB).  pokeSlow converts all pokemon you have saved in the first box of the bank into Slowpokes for no reason besides pure amusement.

Later, I'm thinking about turning this into a Pokemon Editor for the Gen 1 VC games.  I chose to use PHBankGB, because this project was only meant as a one day deal, so it seemed like a good idea to take already extracted Pokemon and edit their species (considering there wasn't a checksum in the gen 1 data structure, it was even easier).

This code will have issues as far as how it is written (like I said, day project), but the functionality works.

There is no GUI, just a few pieces of text.

I also had the pleasure of coding and compiling this on a remote server with a terminal editor, though it is tested on my actual console, as well as the emulator citra.

## Installation

Place the pokeSlow.3dsx and pokeSlow.smdh in the "3ds" directory of your SD Card, open up your favorite homebrew loader, and run the program.

## Credits

Thanks to gocario for PHBankGB, xem for the fun 3DS Homebrew Tutorial, and the Citra development team for their emulator, Citra.
